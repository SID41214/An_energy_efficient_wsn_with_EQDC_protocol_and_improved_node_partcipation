Wireless Sensor Network with improved network efficiency and improved node participation

A wireless sensor network (WSN) is a wireless network that contains distributed independent sensor devices that are meant to monitor physical or environmental conditions.
A WSN consists of a set of connected tiny sensor nodes, which communicate with each other and exchange information and data. These nodes obtain information on the environment such as temperature, pressure, humidity or pollutant, and send this information
to a base station.The latter sends the information to a wired network or activates an alarm or an action, depending on the type and magnitude of data monitored.
Random distribution of nodes in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) means that the sensor nodes are deployed randomly within the network area without following any specific pattern or placement strategy. In other words, the nodes are placed at random
locations, and their positions are not predetermined, but here the network area for distribution is predefined.Random deployment can be used to scale the network to cover a
larger area, as it does not require precise node placement or pre-existing infrastructure,
can help reduce the cost and time of deploying the network, as it does not require extensive planning or surveying of the deployment area, also helps to make the network more
robust and resilient to node failures, as the random distribution can help distribute the
workload and ensure redundancy.On the otherhand, disadvantages includes not guarantee full coverage of the deployment area, and there may be regions that are underserved
or overserved, may result in poor connectivity or gaps in the network, which can affect data collection and transmission, can result in inefficient energy consumption, as
some nodes may be placed in locations with high traffic or low relevance, leading to
unnecessary energy consumption.These can be solved by the proposed system of having
coverage hole detection and rectifying issue by means on improved node participation of
the movable nodes to the coverage hole area.Resulting of solving all the issues that arises due to random distribution of nodes,ie, guarantee the full coverage of the deployment,no connectivity gaps and lower energy consumption.


Delaunay triangulation can be used to optimize the coverage of a WSN by creating a
mesh of triangles that covers the deployment area. This ensures that every point in the
network is covered by at least one sensor node, and helps minimize the number of nodes
required for full coverage.Can be used to optimize the energy consumption of sensor
nodes in WSNs. By ensuring that sensor nodes are not redundantly deployed, Delaunay
triangulation can help reduce the number of active nodes and the amount of energy
consumed by the network.To optimize the routing efficiency in WSNs by providing a
natural framework for the design of routing protocols. The triangles in the mesh can be
used to define communication paths between nodes, and can help reduce the distance
and number of hops required for data transmission. Scale WSNs to cover larger areas,
as it provides a framework for deploying a large number of nodes and optimizing their
placement. This makes it possible to monitor larger areas with greater precision and
accuracy.It can help improve the fault tolerance of WSNs by providing redundancy
and alternate paths for data transmission. If a node fails or becomes unavailable, the
mesh can be reconfigured to ensure that data can still be transmitted through alternate
routes.Used to find the largest free space inside a network for next deployment target.
And determine the optimal sensing coverage radius for each sensor,hence reducing the
energy usage.


Clustering protocols are an important class of protocols used in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) to organize sensor nodes into groups, or clusters, based on their spatial
proximity, energy levels, or other relevant factors. The goal of clustering is to increase
the energy efficiency of the network by reducing the number of nodes that need to transmit data to the base station, which in turn helps to prolong the lifetime of the network.In
a clustering protocol, nodes are divided into groups, with each group being led by a designated cluster head (CH). The CH is responsible for aggregating data from the nodes
in its group and transmitting it to the base station or to another CH in a higher-level
cluster. This helps to reduce the number of nodes that need to transmit data directly
to the base station, which in turn reduces the energy consumption of the network.Also
by the LEACH protocol is designed to reduce energy consumption in WSNs by organizing the nodes into clusters and rotating the role of cluster head (CH) among the
nodes to balance the energy consumption across the network.By organizing the nodes
into clusters and rotating the CH role, the LEACH protocol helps to balance the energy
consumption across the network, which in turn helps to prolong the lifetime of the network,used in large-scale networks, as it does not require a centralized infrastructure for cluster formation.It is adaptive to changes in the network topology, and can adjust the
CH rotation rate based on the energy levels of the nodes.


Also by the proposed system combination of improved node participation by placement of mobale nodes to the network area and energy efficient routing of clustering
protocol of EQDC Protocol (Equi-Quadrant Division Clustering) and optimised Shortest Path Routing by means of minimum spanning tree.Able to obtain the shortest distance between nodes in network hence minimum path between a source and base station.Resulting to obtain increasing the network efficiency of the whole Wireless Sensor
Network.On Random distribution of nodes into a predefined network area consisting
of major issues like coverage hole, sensing range of each node etc. . . These are solved
by improved node participation in the proposed system. Accordingly, the network area
divided into equal four square quadrant of having a single cluster head in each quadrant. Also by optimized shortest path routing of minimum spanning tree for obtaining
minimum path from each cluster head to base station. The purpose of improved node
participation, EQDC and optimized shortest path routing is to increase data reliability, mitigate coverage hole issue, reduce energy consumption for wireless sensor network
(WSN) and increase network efficiency. The experimental results of proposed methodology shows that EQDC protocol, enhanced node engagement and OSPR protocol shows
the tackle coverage hole challenges, curtail power usage, high data reliability, optimized
network productivity.
